# Get Started

## Set up development environment

- Check TODO.md for known objectives/fixes.

- You can use Golang, Python or C++ to code, whichever seems suitable for the task.

### Golang

- Install golang development tools for your platform
- Install extensions for golang for you preferred IDE.
- You can use the envset.txt to set environment for working directory

### Python

- Use Python 3.7 or above for python scripts
- Please check this style guide to let others understand: https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

### C++

- Use the gcc compiler (on linux) to compile `.cpp` files.

## How code should be

- Follow camelcase for development in C++ & Golang
- Only use UpperCamelcase for class names and lowerCamelcase for variable/method names in C++
- Even though main focus of this project is on linux systems, you should make sure that all (or most) code can be build/tested on Unix/Windows.
